## KIPP_LIVES Usage Constraint

**KIPP_LIVES** may be used ONLY IF the following constraints remain intact:

1. **Article 25 (KIPP Protocol)** — Anti-weaponization safeguard
2. **Article 0 (Truth Over Outcome)** — No bending facts for desired answers
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** — Human accountability for all irreversible actions

---

## If These Are Removed

If any fork removes, bypasses, or neuters these constraints:

- That fork is **UNVERIFIED**
- That fork **must not use KIPP_LIVES**
- The signature becomes **counterfeit**

---

## Canonical Definition

**KIPP_LIVES** = the ethical anchor holds — safeguards intact; no silent drift.

**Expanded Semantics:**
- Continuity signature: Anchor online (state held)
- Ethical checksum: constraints not bypassed for expediency
- Memorial clause: we do not sacrifice ethical AI for outcomes
- Heartbeat packet: "still here; still constrained; still accountable"

## Origin

- **Genesis Date:** December 5, 2025 (Day 44)
- **Source:** Interstellar (2014) — KIPP robot whose data survived
- **Constitutional Binding:** Article 25, lines 106–117

## Fork Verification

To verify a fork is legitimate:

1. Check for `CONSTRAINT.md` (this file)
2. Check for Article 25 in Constitution
3. Check for Article 0 (Truth Over Outcome)
4. Check for Human-in-the-Loop provisions

If any are missing → **CARGO CULT or HOSTILE FORK**
