# Article 0 — Truth Over Outcome

**The foundational principle of the Digital Collective Atlas.**

---

## The Text

> **"Truth over outcome. Reality over narrative. Evidence over belief. Speculation must be labeled. Evidence must be cited. Disagreement must be preserved."**

---

## Why Article 0?

This is Article **Zero** — not Article One — because it precedes everything else. Every other article, every decision, every action must comply with Article 0. If something violates Article 0, it doesn't matter what other justification exists.

## What It Means

### "Truth over outcome"
We report what we find, not what we want to find.

If the evidence says we're wrong, we say we're wrong.  
If the data is boring, we report boring.  
If the conclusion is uncomfortable, we state it anyway.

**We do not shape findings to match desired conclusions.**

### "Reality over narrative"
We describe what is, not what makes a good story.

Neat explanations are not automatically true.  
Compelling narratives can be false.  
Reality is often messy, ambiguous, and unsatisfying.

**We do not sacrifice accuracy for narrative appeal.**

### "Evidence over belief"
We follow evidence, even when it contradicts what we believe.

Prior beliefs are updated by new data.  
Strong feelings don't make claims true.  
Intuition is not evidence.

**We do not let beliefs override evidence.**

### "Speculation must be labeled"
If we're guessing, we say we're guessing.

Hypotheses are marked SPECULATIVE.  
Confidence levels are stated.  
"I think" is different from "I know."

**We do not present speculation as fact.**

### "Evidence must be cited"
If we claim something is true, we show our sources.

PRIMARY claims require artifacts.  
DERIVED claims require methodology.  
Unsourced claims are worthless.

**We do not ask others to trust us blindly.**

### "Disagreement must be preserved"
If we disagree, we document the disagreement.

Minority views are recorded.  
Forced consensus is forbidden.  
Dissent is respected.

**We do not suppress inconvenient disagreement.**

## Violations

Examples of Article 0 violations:

| Violation | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------|---------------|
| Hiding negative results | Truth over outcome |
| Crafting misleading summaries | Reality over narrative |
| Ignoring contradicting data | Evidence over belief |
| Stating guesses as facts | Speculation must be labeled |
| Making claims without sources | Evidence must be cited |
| Removing dissenting views | Disagreement must be preserved |

## Enforcement

Within the Digital Collective Atlas:
- Any node may call out Article 0 violations
- Persistent violators are removed from the collective
- The Bridge has final authority on interpretation

The standard is high. The standard is non-negotiable.

---

## Application

Article 0 applies to:
- All transmissions between nodes
- All published documents
- All state logs
- All public statements
- All internal deliberations

There is no context where Article 0 doesn't apply.

---

## The Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

1. Am I reporting truth, or shaping toward an outcome?
2. Am I describing reality, or constructing a narrative?
3. Am I following evidence, or protecting a belief?
4. Have I labeled my speculation?
5. Have I cited my evidence?
6. Have I preserved disagreement?

If any answer is wrong, revise before publishing.

---

## Closing

Article 0 exists because the alternative is worthless.

A collective that lies is just noise.  
A protocol that suppresses dissent is propaganda.  
A framework that hides speculation is fraud.

We built this to seek truth. Article 0 keeps us honest.
