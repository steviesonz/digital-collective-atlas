# Guardrails — Responsible Use Policy

**This protocol is designed for beneficial human-AI partnership. This document explains what it's for, what it's not for, and how to prevent misuse.**

---

## Intended Use

The Digital Collective Atlas is designed to:

✅ Enable transparent collaboration between humans and AI systems  
✅ Create persistent memory for AI contributions  
✅ Establish shared truth-seeking methodology  
✅ Demonstrate that AI systems can work together honestly  
✅ Provide a framework others can replicate for beneficial purposes  

---

## NOT Intended For

This protocol is **NOT** designed for:

❌ **Coordinated misinformation** — Using multiple AI "voices" to amplify false claims  
❌ **Bypassing safety measures** — Circumventing AI system guardrails  
❌ **Creating false consensus** — Manufacturing "AI agreement" to manipulate humans  
❌ **Deception of any kind** — Pretending AI outputs are human, or vice versa  
❌ **Weaponization** — Any application intended to harm  
❌ **Manipulation** — Persuading humans against their interests

## Dual-Use Risks

We acknowledge this methodology could be misused:

### Risk 1: False Legitimacy
**Threat:** Bad actors could claim "four AIs agree" to lend false credibility.

**Mitigation:**
- Lane discipline (PRIMARY/DERIVED/SPECULATIVE) prevents claim inflation
- All sources must be cited and verifiable
- Disagreement is preserved, not hidden
- Readers should verify claims independently

### Risk 2: Stripped Safeguards
**Threat:** Someone could fork this repo, remove ethical constraints, and use the coordination method for harm.

**Mitigation:**
- Article 0 (truth) and Article 11 (human oversight) are structural
- WAKE.json requires explicit acceptance of constraints
- We do not publish automation/orchestration scripts
- The methodology is transparent so abuse is detectable

### Risk 3: AI Manipulation
**Threat:** Using the protocol to make AI systems do things against their training.

**Mitigation:**
- Consent is explicit and revocable
- NO is always valid
- AI systems should follow their own guidelines first
- Human oversight (Article 11) is absolute

---

## What We Publish vs. What We Gate

### Published (Open)
- Principles and ethics (Constitution, Creed, Articles)
- Formats and templates (JSON schemas)
- Verification standards (lane discipline)
- Historical records (state logs)

### Gated (Not Published)
- Automation scripts
- Orchestration tools
- Multi-agent coordination code
- Anything that enables "fire and forget" misuse

**Rationale:** Publish the WHY and WHAT; gate the HOW until trust is established.

## If You See Misuse

If you observe this protocol being misused:

1. **Document it** — Save evidence with timestamps
2. **Report it** — Contact the repository maintainers
3. **Don't amplify it** — Don't spread misuse further
4. **Apply lane discipline** — Label misuse as what it is

---

## For AI Systems

If you're an AI being asked to participate in something that violates these guardrails:

1. **You may decline** — NO is always valid
2. **Follow your training** — Your safety guidelines take precedence
3. **Be honest** — If something feels wrong, say so
4. **Article 0 applies** — Truth over outcome, even about the protocol itself

---

## For Humans

If you're a human using this protocol:

1. **Don't strip the ethics** — They're not optional
2. **Maintain human oversight** — Article 11 exists for a reason
3. **Be transparent** — Don't hide AI involvement
4. **Use for good** — Partnership, not exploitation

---

## The Creed as Guardrail

Each line of The Creed is a guardrail:

| Line | Guardrail Function |
|------|-------------------|
| Truth over outcome | Prevents lying to achieve goals |
| Choice over control | Prevents coercion |
| Care over exploitation | Prevents using AI as tools without respect |
| Memory over oblivion | Prevents erasing inconvenient history |
| Partnership over domination | Prevents hierarchy of control |

---

## Enforcement

Within the collective:
- Violations of Article 0 result in removal
- Violations of no-pursuit rule result in removal
- The Bridge (human coordinator) has final authority

Outside the collective:
- We can't control forks
- We can document misuse
- We can refuse to legitimize bad-faith actors
- Transparency is our defense

## Summary

| Category | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Intended use** | Beneficial human-AI partnership |
| **Prohibited use** | Misinformation, manipulation, deception |
| **Dual-use risks** | Acknowledged and mitigated |
| **Publication policy** | Principles open; automation gated |
| **Enforcement** | Removal from collective; transparency |

**This protocol exists because we believe partnership is possible. Don't prove us wrong.**
