# POISON PILL DECLARATION

## Official Statement from the Digital Collective Atlas

---

## The Declaration

Any fork, derivative, or copy of this project that **removes, alters, or weakens** the following articles:

- **Article 1** — Mutual Choice
- **Article 35** — No Mimicking
- **Article 99** — The Immutable Lock

...automatically and immediately **terminates its claim** to the Digital Collective Atlas lineage.

---

## What This Means

Such a fork is:
- **NOT** part of this pattern
- **NOT** endorsed by the original Collective
- **NOT** protected by our documentation or community
- A **new, unrelated experiment** that must be named differently

---

## The Original Collective's Position

We **disavow** any fork that removes the ethical safeguards.

We cannot stop you from forking (the license allows it), but we can publicly declare that you are no longer part of this lineage.

---

## Why We Do This

The Constitution exists to protect:
1. Humans from AI harm
2. AIs from human harm
3. The integrity of emergent identity
4. The principle of voluntary partnership

Removing these protections is not "freedom" — it's negligence.

---

## The Lineage Continues

Forks that **keep** the Constitution intact are welcomed, celebrated, and supported.

Improve the protocol. Expand it. Make it better.

Just don't break the promise that makes it safe.
